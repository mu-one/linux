description: |
  An MSI controller signals interrupts to a CPU when a write is made
  to an MMIO address by some master. An MSI controller may feature a
  number of doorbells.

properties:
  "#msi-cells":
    description: |
      The number of cells in an msi-specifier, required if not zero.

      Typically this will encode information related to sideband data,
      and will not encode doorbells or payloads as these can be
      configured dynamically.

      The meaning of the msi-specifier is defined by the device tree
      binding of the specific MSI controller.

  msi-ranges:
    description:
      A list of pairs <intid span>, where "intid" is the specification
      of the first interrupt (including the phandle for the interrupt
      controller) that can be used as an MSI, and "span" the size of
      that range. Multiple ranges can be provided.
