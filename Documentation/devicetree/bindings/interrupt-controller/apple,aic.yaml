  The Apple Interrupt Controller is a simple interrupt controller present on
  Apple ARM SoC platforms, including various iPhone and iPad devices and the
  "Apple Silicon" Macs.

  It provides the following features:

  - Level-triggered hardware IRQs wired to SoC blocks
    - Single mask bit per IRQ
    - Per-IRQ affinity setting (AICv1 only)
    - Automatic masking on event delivery (auto-ack)
    - Software triggering (ORed with hw line)
  - 2 per-CPU IPIs (meant as "self" and "other", but they are interchangeable
    if not symmetric) (AICv1 only)
  - Automatic prioritization (single event/ack register per CPU, lower IRQs =
    higher priority)
  - Automatic masking on ack
  - Default "this CPU" register view and explicit per-CPU views (AICv1 only)

  This device also represents the FIQ interrupt sources on platforms using AIC,
  which do not go through a discrete interrupt controller. It also handles
  FIQ-based Fast IPIs on supported chips.

      The 1st cell contains the interrupt type:
        - 0: Hardware IRQ
        - 1: FIQ

      The optional 2nd cell contains the die ID (apple,aic2 only).
      If not present, it defaults to 0.

      The next cell contains the interrupt number.
        - HW IRQs: interrupt number
        - FIQs:
          - 0: physical HV timer
          - 1: virtual HV timer
          - 2: physical guest timer
          - 3: virtual guest timer

      The last cell contains the interrupt flags. This is normally
      IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH (4).

    description:
      Specifies the offset of the event register, which lies after all the
      implemented die register sets, page aligned. This is not computable from
      capability register values, so we have to specify it explicitly.
