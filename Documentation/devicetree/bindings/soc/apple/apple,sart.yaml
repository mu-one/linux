title: Apple SART DMA address filter

maintainers:
  - Sven Peter <sven@svenpeter.dev>

description:
  Apple SART is a simple address filter for some DMA transactions.
  Regions of physical memory must be added to the SART's allow
  list before before any DMA can target these. Unlike a proper
  IOMMU no remapping can be done and special support in the
  consumer driver is required since not all DMA transactions of
  a single device are subject to SART filtering.
