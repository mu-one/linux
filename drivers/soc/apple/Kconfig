	  Apple SoCs such as the M1 come with various co-processors running
	  their proprietary RTKit operating system. This option enables support
	  for the common IPC protocl used by these.

	  Apple SART is a simple DMA address filter used on Apple SoCs such
	  as the M1. It is usually required for the NVMe coprocessor.
